# PortfolioProject-1-Covid-Data-Analysis


In this portfolio project, I used SQL Server to extract, transform, and filter data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using my newly acquired skills in data visualization and reporting with Power BI, I developed a dynamic dashboard that displays key stats and insights related to the pandemic.

The dashboard provides an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on various countries and regions, including case counts, mortality rates, and vaccination rates. It also features interactive charts and graphs that allow users to explore the data in more detail.

To analyze the data, I utilized various SQL techniques such as joins and views. Using joins, I combined data from multiple tables and filtered the data based on specific criteria to extract the necessary information. I also created views to organize and simplify complex data queries, allowing for easier analysis and reporting.

Additionally, I implemented aggregate functions to summarize data and generate statistical insights. I used filtering functions to extract relevant data from large datasets and ensure that the dashboard displayed accurate information. These SQL techniques allowed me to manipulate and analyze the data effectively, providing valuable insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

By utilizing SQL and Power BI to develop this COVID-19 dashboard, I have gained practical experience in data analysis and visualization, as well as demonstrated my ability to effectively communicate complex data insights to a non-technical audience.
